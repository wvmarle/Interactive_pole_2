# Interative_pole_2

This is a project developed with local artist Natalie Wong for her installation "Playloop".

Here a short documentary on [the making of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JrBQPtyxug), and this video shows the final project [in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvQCBNEG-Rc).

Each pole contains about 300 colour changing LEDs, two high capacity power banks (as a single one can not deliver sufficient current for all those LEDs), a DFPlayer Mini MP3 player, a speaker on top for the sound, and a VL53L0X distance sensor to detect a hand above the pole to switch on and off the music.

The program has a Serial interface to allow for easy setting of the colours of each individual pole, and every pole has a unique music sample.
